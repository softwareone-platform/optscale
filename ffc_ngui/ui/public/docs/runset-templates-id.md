### **Summary**

Runset is a collection of runs that will be automatically created upon the launch of the runset. Each run will be executed 
on a cloud instance (runner). The runset expects that the user script with integrated ```optscale-arcee``` will be executed 
on the runner. As a result, a new run will be added to the runset task. Otherwise, the runset will be considered 
as failed.

Use this page to visualize and create runsets based on the Runset Template.
