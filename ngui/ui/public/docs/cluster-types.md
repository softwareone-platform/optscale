### **Summary**

The Cluster Types page provides a table for viewing and managing cluster types. 
Use this page to create or delete cluster types. Deleting a 
cluster type will immediately disassemble all clusters of that type. You can 
also prioritize cluster types according to your needs. Remember to initiate 
the re-apply process to fully reassemble clusters after making changes.

### **View**

-   Details: Monitor the list of cluster types.  

-   Privileges of the Organization Manager: View an extended table of cluster types 
and access related actions.

### **Actions**

-   Add a Cluster Type: Easily create a new cluster type by clicking the green "Add" button. 
Specify the cluster type name and tag key.

-   Manage Cluster Types: Click on the buttons in the "Actions" to prioritize, promote, demote, 
deprioritize, or delete cluster type.

-   Cluster Your Resources: Click on the "Re-apply cluster types" button to trigger 
a new resource allocation sequence that uses the current order of cluster types as a rule.

### **Tips**

-   Automatically Adding Resources to Clusters: Sub-resources are automatically added to clusters 
based on cluster type definitions when they are discovered in OptScale (through billing or direct discovery).

-   Monitor Resource Utilization Regularly: Regularly check the resource utilization of each 
cluster type to ensure youâ€™re not over-provisioned or under-provisioned. Adjust configurations 
as needed to optimize performance and budget.
