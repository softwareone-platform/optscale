-   Quickly Revoke Access: Use the trash can icon in the Actions column to promptly remove users who no longer need access to your organization. This helps reduce potential security risks and keeps the user list up to date.

-   Assign Multiple Roles: Assign multiple roles to balance flexibility with security.

-   Review User Roles: Audit user roles regularly to ensure they're still relevant to each person's responsibilities.
