  "checklist.item1.description": "Analyze cloud regions FinOps for Cloud in use: the costs may vary from one to another, and it is recommended to optimize the region usage and move to the cheapest one. The cost explorer provides a transparent summary of organization cloud expenses. Get statistics by data sources, pools, and owners for more comfortable separation.

  "checklist.item4.description": "Once you have determined your internal rules for resource tagging, it becomes easy to describe these rules within FinOps For Cloud to automatically assign the resources to target pools and owners to track the usage. Creating auto-assignment rules will allow tracking and organizing the assets automatically. You do not need to sort and assign the items manually or research their origin if they fit the existing rules. If they do not, simply add new auto-assignment rules for those resources.",
  "checklist.item7.description": "Create TTL and constraint rules in FinOps For Cloud, and establish clean-up policies with your team to get rid of obsolete and unused assets. Without TTL it's easy to forget about some resource and just lose it, but this resource setting will track the asset, and the solution will notify you when TTL constraint is violated."
