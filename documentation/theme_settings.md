# How to change the theme settings

Each organization has its own unique theme. Please note that the changes you save affect only the current organization.

Use these instructions to update fonts, the color palette, and the color palette of graphics:

1\. Go to `https://<your-cluster-ip>/theme-settings`.

2\. Select a tab: **Typography** (for fonts and text styles), **Palette** (for primary and secondary colors), **Chart Palette** (for graph and visualization colors).

3\. Modify the settings. Each tab contains different sections for customization. Adjust fonts, colors, or chart styles as needed.

4\. Each section has its own "Save" button. Click "Save" after making any changes to apply them.

5\. Refresh the page to ensure your changes take effect. Check your organizationâ€™s theme to confirm updates.
