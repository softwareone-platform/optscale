# Kibana logs

This guide is intended to help users navigate Kibana to view logs when encountering issues. By following the outlined steps, youâ€™ll be able to efficiently access and analyze log data, enabling you to identify and troubleshoot potential problems.

1. Open http://cluster_ip:30081
2. Use the username and password from your own user_template.yaml file ([optscale/optscale-deploy/overlay/user_template.yml](../optscale-deploy/overlay/user_template.yml#L102))
3. Go to the **Discover** tab
4. Filter the data by container name `name: *<container_name>*`
5. Add a **message** filter.

> [!NOTE] 
> If kibana prompts you to create an index pattern, create it with the following parameters:
> ![kibana_index_pattern](images/kibana-index-pattern.png)

**Troubleshooting**

If address `http://cluster_ip:30081` is not available, ensure that you used the `--with-elk` flag on cluster installation step ([GitHub - hystax/optscale](https://github.com/hystax/optscale/tree/integration?tab=readme-ov-file#cluster-update))  and `elk-0` pod in the running state.
